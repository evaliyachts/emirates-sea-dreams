# English URL Ownership and Redirect Plan

## Implementation PR 5 publication decision

The four existing published commercial/hub owners were enriched in place. No candidate URL was created, no path form changed, and no redirect or consolidation was approved. The generated publication set remains the four base owners plus 19 verified yacht details (23 sitemap URLs). The six historical commercial candidates remain unrouted 404s outside the manifest, while the 18 service details and five blocked yacht owners remain unpublished. Query × Page and Links evidence is still mandatory before a URL-ownership migration.

## Implementation PR 2 status

The typed ownership implementation is now recorded in the non-runtime root `seo/` modules. It preserves exactly 52 current sitemap paths, keeps the six historical commercial candidates outside the manifest, and records two redirect candidates with no destination selected. Approved redirects and approved commercial consolidations remain **zero**. No public sitemap, redirect, canonical, route, or HTTP behavior changed. Query × Page, Links, and Page Indexing issue examples remain required before any candidate advances.

This is an evidence-gated migration map, not a redirect implementation. Canonical route ownership must be completed before static restoration. No current commercial URL may be redirected, merged or removed until query-by-page Search Console data is reviewed, unless it is proven to have no indexation, traffic, links or historical value.

## Global rules

1. Preserve the English site’s exact historic path form until evidence supports change; do not normalize it to match Arabic trailing slashes.
2. PR 2 assigns one canonical owner per intent and records legacy routes. PR 3 renders only keep/enrich owners.
3. A redirect must be direct `301`, one hop, and point to a `200` canonical destination.
4. Do not redirect unknown paths to the homepage.
5. Preserve query strings where safe and avoid wildcard rules that capture preview hosts.
6. Do not publish a redirect until destination content, internal links, sitemap and canonical are ready in the same release.

## Search Console disposition gate

The 2026-06-30 Page Indexing summary does not approve any route disposition change. It supplies aggregate status counts, not URL-level query, page, link or redirect evidence.

Still required before dispositions can be reviewed:

- the six example URLs reported as Not found (404);
- the two URLs reported as Crawled – currently not indexed;
- the one URL reported as Page with redirect, including its chain and destination;
- Query × Page performance evidence;
- Links report evidence.

Approved redirects remain **zero**. The 10,553 property-level impressions are not page evidence and cannot approve a redirect or consolidation.

## Static and hub URLs

| Current URL | Response | Proposed owner/action | Destination | Evidence | Risk |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | 200 | Keep/enrich | — | Only live canonical owner | Medium: overloaded intent |
| `/yachts` | 404 | Preserve; catalogue/for-rent candidate | — | Sitemap/source; GSC missing | High if removed |
| `/offers` | 404 | Preserve pending verified pricing role | — | Sitemap/source; fixed claims unapproved | High |
| `/services` | 404 | Preserve as event/service hub candidate | — | 18 child records | High |
| `/occasions` | 404 | Preserve pending hub-role decision | — | Seven records, no detail routes | Medium |
| `/about` | 404 | Preserve/support owner | — | Source | Low |
| `/faq` | 404 | Preserve/support owner; rewrite only after facts | — | Source | Medium |
| `/contact` | 404 | Preserve booking/contact endpoint | — | Historic booking intent | High |
| `/terms` | 404 | Preserve legal URL pending approved copy | — | Footer/source | High/legal |
| `/privacy` | 404 | Preserve legal URL pending approved copy | — | Footer/source | High/legal |

## Yacht URLs

Unless noted, all return `404`; the proposed action is **preserve as a provisional yacht canonical owner**, verify the record, and render only if it passes the strict data/media contract.

| Current path | Proposed action | Possible destination | Evidence/risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/yachts/evali-yacht-55ft-yacht-rental-dubai` | Rename/consolidation candidate; preserve until GSC/link evidence | Approved neutral 55-foot canonical, if created | Evali branding prohibited; redirect cannot be chosen without history |

## Candidate commercial URLs not in the current sitemap

Examples such as `/dubai-yacht-booking`, `/luxury-yacht-rental-dubai`, `/yacht-charter-dubai`, `/yacht-for-rent-dubai`, `/yacht-hire-dubai` and `/yacht-rental-in-dubai` are **candidates, not current owners**. PR 2 must review historic URL and GSC evidence before selecting or creating any. Do not redirect one to another merely for a cleaner slug.

## Current consolidation count

- Approved redirects: **0**.
- Likely evidence-gated consolidation/rename candidates: **2**.
- Candidate 1: combined engagement/wedding service versus the two specific owners.
- Candidate 2: Evali-branded 55-foot yacht route versus a future approved neutral owner.

## PR 3 HTTP publication state

The ownership manifest remains at 52 records, but only `/`, `/yachts`, `/services`, and `/occasions` are currently eligible for static canonical publication. The three inner routes use exact Netlify status-200 file mappings and retain their non-trailing-slash public forms. These mappings are not SEO redirects.

The remaining 48 manifest paths and all six commercial candidates remain unpublished direct-request 404s. Approved 301/302 redirects remain **0**, approved commercial consolidations remain **0**, and no wildcard or homepage fallback rule is active.

## PR 4 yacht ownership result

The strict yacht review did not approve any detail owner for publication. All 24 yacht paths remain represented in the 52-record manifest, blocked from static output, absent from the four-URL sitemap, and direct 404. The existing `/yachts` owner remains a static 200 but links only to strict publishable records, currently none.

The historical 55-foot branded path and combined service overlap remain candidates only. Approved redirects remain **0** and approved commercial consolidations remain **0**. No neutral yacht slug, redirect destination, wildcard, or slash migration was created.

## PR 4B yacht publication result

Owner-approved facts and technically verified media clear 19 existing yacht manifest owners for exact non-trailing-slash static publication. Five yacht owners remain direct 404s and outside the sitemap. No path was renamed, no new slug was created, and approved redirects and commercial consolidations remain **zero**. The generated sitemap now contains the four base owners plus the 19 published yacht details.

## PR 6B approved-service publication result

Ten exact historical non-trailing-slash service owners are approved for static publication without renaming or consolidation. Eight service owners remain direct 404s and outside the sitemap, including the combined engagement/wedding overlap candidate. The generated sitemap expands from 23 to 33 owners while the route manifest remains 52 records.

No service owner redirects to another service, no occasion detail is created, and no commercial candidate is activated. Approved redirects and approved commercial consolidations remain **zero**. Query × Page and Links evidence is still required before either the combined-service candidate or the historical branded yacht path may advance.
